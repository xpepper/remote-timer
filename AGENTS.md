# Agent Configuration

This file contains instructions for agentic coding assistants working on this repository.

## Technology Stack (To Be Determined)
The technology stack for this project is yet to be decided. Please wait for further instructions before implementing any specific technology choices.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Follow the existing code formatting in the project
- Use meaningful comments for complex logic
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces, depending on technology)
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/components

## Naming Conventions
- Variables: descriptive and concise (e.g., `timerDuration`, `isPaused`)
- Functions: action-oriented (e.g., `startTimer`, `pauseTimer`)
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `TimerDisplay`, `ControlButtons`)
- Files: kebab-case (e.g., `timer-display.js`, `control-buttons.js`)

## Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch blocks where appropriate
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors for debugging purposes

## Testing
- Write unit tests for individual functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Imports and Dependencies
- Group imports logically (standard library, third-party, local)
- Use absolute imports when possible for better readability
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-justified

## Git Workflow
- Make small, focused commits with clear messages
- Follow conventional commit message format
- Push changes frequently to avoid large divergences
